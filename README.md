# Hibernate Weekend Homework

Your task is to model relationships between classes and persist them via Hibernate.  Practice using annotations, table relationships and inheritance.
We're looking for accurate representations, don't force the use of table relationships or inheritance if it doesn't make sense.

## MVP
Create CRUD functions through a DBHelper.


### Sports
Model the relationships between Competitions, Teams, Managers, Players etc.


## Extensions


- Sports:
  - sort teams in league on points total
  - play games which can increase teams points/knock teams out of competitions


### REMEMBER

TDD your models if appropriate.

Be creative, expand your model to your hearts content.
